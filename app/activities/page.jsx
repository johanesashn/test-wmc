      description: `“"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.” (Matthew 19:14). Jesus has a deep love for children and desires for them to know Him more. To support this, we offer Sunday School classes for infants up to children in the sixth grade, helping them to grow in their knowledge of Jesus and learn to follow Him. Classes are organized according to age or school grade, ensuring that each child receives teaching suited to their level. With the guidance of over 20 dedicated Sunday School teachers and assistants, children will have the opportunity to develop spiritually in a creative and joyful environment. The classes are as follows: Batila for children under 5 years, Grade 1-2, Grade 3-4, and Grade 5-6. This structure allows each child to thrive and grow closer to Jesus among supportive and caring mentors.`,

      description: `I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. (Psalm 139:14).
        The teenage years can be difficult for many, including in their spiritual life. They are considered 'too old' to join in Sunday School, but 'too young' to be in the Youth group. So, we provide Teenagers Fellowship to be a home where they can grow together in faith through Sunday Service, Bible Study group and other fellowship. Since their young age, they will truly know that they are precious in God's sight and they also learn to serve one another.`,

        Full of energy, potentials, and innovative ideas are identic with young age. And it is a privilege to dedicate them all to the glory of God. The existence of Wesley Methodist Church is one of the evidences of it. By the grace of God, this church was started in 1958 through MYF. God used young people to fulfill His calling in the past, and He is still doing it now. We welcome all young people to join and experience God's love together in a warm, joyful and youthful environment. Let's grow together in obedience to God, to be His instruments of glory, like the motto of MYF: “Christ Above All”.`,

      description: `“Therefore go and make disciples of all nations…” (Matthew 20:19). We are called to be Christ's disciples, and He wants us to disciples others. A Christian disciple is a person who follows Jesus Christ and accepts and assists in the spreading of the good news of salvation through Him. We must become Christ's followers so that we can lead others to be His disciples. As a church, we are called “to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ” (Eph. 4:12-13). This is a class of teaching, sharing, discussing and praying.
