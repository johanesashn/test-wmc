      desc: "During the early years of the Methodist work in Medan, Sunday worship services were held in three different languages: Chinese, English and Malay by Rev. Newton Gottschall, who for many years served as missionary in North Sumatera (1921 - 1922 and 1929 - 1935) wrote: ||quote The church was housed during those early years in the center Chinese Shop House on Kapiteinweg. Besides here, services of worship, Church School classes, and social gatherings were held in the headquarters for the Y.M.C.A. corner at far right. These were conducted in Chinese, English and Malay Languages. ||English, then, was one of the three languages used in conducting worship services since the beginning (1905) of the history of the Methodist presence in this region. This practice continued until 1942 when the Japanese invaded Indonesia, which at that time was known as the Netherlands East Indies. Upon the Japanese surrender to the Allies in 1945, Indonesia declared her independence, i.e., on August 17 that year. But then the war against the Dutch colonial power started and continued until 1949 when Indonesia’s sovereignty was finally recognized by the world. During the war years (the Japanese occupation as well as the war for independence) the English work was discontinued, but the Chinese and Indonesian Methodist congregations continued to hold Sunday services quite regularly.",

Klaus, Mr. and Mrs. Pyke, Mr. and Mrs. Lim Ka Oen (Kalimoen) and Mr. Thomas Flight devoted much of their time to help organize and lead the English speaking M.Y.F. which was mostly made up of students from the Methodist English School on Jalan Hakka (now Jalan Haryono MT). In addition to its regular Christian youth activities, this organization also conducted regular Sunday worship services. Several times the M.Y.F. sent some of its members to attend the All-Malaya M.Y.F. Institute (like retreat) held annually in Malaysia (then known as Malaya, comprising the present Western Malaysia and Singapore). Those who attended the institutes were spiritually uplifted and they brought new ideas to the M.Y.F. in Medan. The institutes also enhanced their leadership ability. Among the young people who played important leadership roles in leading the M.Y.F. in those early years were Chan Chin Yap, Shierly Lim, Ho Thian Siong, Banggas Panggabean, Oh Fing Hwa, Rosna Silitonga, and Laurentius Hutauruk and Robert L. Tobing, to name just a few. The youth activities were done mostly at the school, but the Sunday worship services were usually held at the Chinese Methodist Church located nearby. Missionaries who resided in and around Medan took turns in preaching at the English-speaking services.",

From then on, most of the M.Y.F. activities took place at the new school, while the Sunday worship services were held at the Batak Methodist Church adjacent to the school. || The next year, Rev. Frank Argelander (a Methodist missionary stationed in Tebing Tinggi), Dr. Charles Shoemaker (the Methodist English School Principal), Mr. Mark Reames (a young short-term missionary who taught at The Methodist English School), Rev. Gusta Robinett (the Superintendent of the Methodist Chinese District) and Mrs. Kalimoen (an active Methodist lay-woman who also taught at The Methodist English School) decided that it was time to establish an English-speaking Methodist Church, with some of the M.Y.F. members who were already Christians as its core congregation. In anticipation of the establishment of the English-speaking church, a preparatory class was begun. Rev. Argelander, Rev. Robinett, Miss Wolcott, Mr. Reames and others took turns in teaching the class. || On January 17, 1958, Wesley Methodist Church was born. Mr. Mark Reames was appointed by Bishop Hobart B. Amstutz as its Supply Pastor 2 in charge of the day-to-day activities, and Rev. Frank Argelander of Tebing Tinggi did the Elder’s ministerial responsibility. During the first worship service of the new congregation on January 17, 1958, 17 new members from the confirmation class were added to the little fold either through adult baptism or confirmation by Bishop Hobart B. Amstutz. || The newly-born church immediately launched a visitation campaign under the leadership of Mr. Mark Reames, the Supply Pastor. Many members, including Official Board and M.Y.F. members, took part in the program. They went out two-by two, as Christ’s disciples of old, to seek prospective members and asked them to make a commitment to Christ and join the church. In March 1958, a new confirmation class was begun, and on July 6 that year those who successfully completed the class were received as new members either through confirmation or adult baptism by Bishop Hobart B. Amstutz. || With the establishment of Wesley Methodist Church, the English-speaking M.Y.F. became more active. At that time the President was Oh Fing Hwa, and the Vice President, Robert L. Tobing. Ho Thian Siong was in charge of the “Medan M.Y.F. Bulletin” (a bi-monthly magazine printed in the English language). The M.Y.F. officials and members took turns in acting as ushers, greeters and liturgists every Sunday. They also took part in visitation and many other programs run by the church. The M.Y.F. Choir under the directorship of Mr. Michailoff, a teacher at the Methodist English School, sang during the Sunday services which continued to be held at the Batak Methodist Church. Miss Esther Jacobs was the pianist.",

      desc: "Something should be said about Wesley Church members who went to theological schools during the fifties. In the beginning, Wesley relied on the missionaries for pastoral leadership, God, however, had prepared some young people, Bataks and Chinese, for the ministry. In 1954 Oei Guan Swie and Hamonangan Panggabean, who were both graduates of The Methodist English School and members of the M.Y.F. had gone abroad to study for the ministry. Oei Guan Swie went to the United States, and after completing his formal theological education became a Pastor of the Methodist Church in that country. Hamonangan Panggabean went to Trinity Theological College in Singapore. After graduation, he proceeded to go to the United States for further study. Subsequently he served for one year, 1959, as Pastor of Wesley Methodist Church. 3Later on other Methodist English School graduates who were also members of Wesley Methodist Church and its M.Y.F. also went to Trinity Theological College, such as 1) Shirley Lim, the Kalimoens’ third daughter (1956); 2) Phoa Kim Hong (1957); and 3) Robert L. Tobing (1958). Upon the completion of her studies at Trinity, Shirley Lim in 1960 returned to Medan and served as Associate Pastor of Wesley from 1961 to 1962. 4Phoa Kim Hong married a Singaporean and never returned to Indonesia. By the end of 1962 Robert L. Tobing, upon his graduation from Trinity College, returned to Indonesia. In January, 1963, he was ordained by Bishop Hobart B. Amstutz and appointed to serve as Pastor of the Batak Methodist Church in Kisaran. In later years he served as Pastor of Wesley for fourteen years.",

Wesley Church, therefore, could no longer expect the school as a major source of new members as it did in the fifties. The church, however, looked for old graduates of the school and other English-speaking residents of Medan. Many of those who were visited came and joined Wesley. The Pastoral leadership during the entire decade, along with the first half of the 70s were in the hands of missionaries; Rev. Cyrill G. Baker (1960 and 1962); Rev. Gusta Robinett (1961); Rev. Denver Stone (1963); Rev. W.L. Armstrong (August, 1964 - May 1968); Rev. Lionel Muthiah (January 1969 - April 1972); Rev. J. Wesley Day (May 1972 - May 1973) and Rev.

      period: "Spectacular Growth",
      desc: "From 1966 to 1969 Wesley Church experienced a spectacular growth in church attendance almost every Sunday. This unique phenomenon can be explained this way: Following the abortive communist coup in Indonesia in late September, 1965, the victorious New Order Government had made it known that every Indonesian citizen should embrace a religion which might be chosen out of the five officially recognized ones, namely Islam, Protestant Christianity, Roman Catholicism, Buddhism and Hinduism. 6 This was an effort on the part of the New Order Government to persuade citizens to disassociate themselves from communism as well as to prevent any new communist menace in Indonesia. Many new comers, therefore, attended the church services. But by the end of the decade most of these new people had left the church. Other churches throughout Indonesia also experienced a marked increase in church attendance following the collapse of the communist movement in Indonesia and followed by a gradual downward trend toward the end of the decade. There is only one explanation for this: These new people joined the church not out of commitment to Christ but because of the fear of being stigmatized as atheists. (It may be noted that communism is usually considered as opposed to religion.) Therefore when things became quiet in Indonesia, those who had not actually made commitment to Christ gradually slipped away from the church. Nevertheless, the number of faithful adult members of Wesley Church at the end of the decade of the 60s was still over one hundred.",

      period: "Construction Of Our Own Church Building",
      desc: "During the second half of the seventies Wesley Church focused her programs on fund raising for land and a church building of its own. It is possible that some of the missionaries who served as pastors of Wesley Methodist Church did not expect that the English-speaking church would continue to exist after they had gone. || In 1968 there was a quiet negotiation between Wesley Methodist Church and the Indonesian-speaking Methodist Church on Jalan Madong Lubis about a possible merger between the two congregations. The idea was that the Indonesian Church could have two services every Sunday led by a bilingual Pastor, one using Indonesian and the other, English. It happened that at that time Rev. Robert L. Tobing, a bilingual Pastor, was serving at the Indonesian Church. There was a strong evidence for the seriousness of the talk: One year prior to the negotiation, Wesley Methodist Church had sent an application for land and building support to the Board of Global Ministries (BOGM) in New York, United States. Some Methodist Churches and individuals in the United States had promised to raise funds or give donations to help Wesley purchase a suitable property for church building. When the money was forthcoming, the Official Board of Wesley Methodist Church decided to direct it to the Indonesian-speaking Methodist Church which at that time needed money to buy land for church building. But the merger never took place. The money, however, was irretrievable because it was the decision of Wesley Church with permission from the BOGM in the United States to direct the building support to the Indonesian Church. || Meanwhile Wesley Methodist Church continued to stay at Jalan Hang Tuah. Since the missionary Pastors’ salaries were paid by the BOGM in the United States, Wesley could use the money coming from offerings and other sources for its ordinary operation expenses as well as to support several mission activities and social services in Medan and the outlaying areas. || In 1974 Rev. Robert L. Tobing was appointed as Associate Pastor, with Rev. Bill Rice as Pastor of Wesley. Since missionaries were no longer readily available, and Rev. Bill Rice and his family were leaving for the United States, Rev. Robert L. Tobing in 1975 was appointed Pastor of Wesley and continued to serve this church until 1981. In those days Rev. Robert L. Tobing was assisted, especially in visitation, by Mr. Thio Chan Sin, Mrs. Lilyana Kalimoen and Mrs. Sondang Tobing. Fund raising for land and church building became one of the priorities in the agenda. Wesley Church Official Board and the entire congregation agreed and supported the program. In 1976 a bazaar was held at the Jalan Thamrin Methodist School to raise money for land. From 1977 until 1978 Rev. Jonathan Napiun served as Associate Pastor and helped to strengthen the fund-raising program. In 1978 a piece of land at Jalan Sultan Agung was purchased. In 1979 a church building (the present fellowship hall) was erected on the property. By this time Rev. Warren Harbert was Associate Pastor. Since the new church building was considered too far from the city and its surroundings were untidy and without paved streets, Wesley congregation decided not to make use of it immediately. Indeed, at the time the church looked strange standing in the middle of nowhere. But Wesley Church people had a long-range vision: Soon the place would become an ideal place for a church. And so Wesley continued to raise funds -- this time for land extension. || In 1979 several Bible Study and Prayer Groups were formed. This program was very effective in leading new people to Christ and the church. Many students majoring in English from the Methodist University at Jalan Hang Tuah, many of whom were not Christians, joined the groups faithfully. A number of them eventually became members of Wesley. It was then seen that the English Department of the University could take the place of the old Methodist English School as a fertile ground for evangelism and a good source of new members.",

Tobing and his family moved to Australia in January, 1982, Rev. Yu Hok Bachtiar took his place. But six months later Rev. Fred Ingold became Pastor of Wesley Methodist Church. This Pastor motivated the church to move to the hitherto unused facilities on Jalan Sultan Agung and to raise more money for further extension. On November 20, 1983, the day when Wesley Church congregation celebrated its 25th anniversary, the church building (the present fellowship hall was dedicated by Bishop H. Sitorus. From then on preparations were made to move from Jalan Hang Tuah to the new premises. On May 5, 1984, the first service was held in the building on Jalan Sultan Agung. By then many big houses around the church had sprung up and the streets were paved. It had become an ideal place for a church location. || In December 1984, when Rev. Frederick Ingold was still Pastor, the land to the rear of the old church was purchased. The building of the first parsonage began in early 1985, and on May 5 it was dedicated by Bishop H. Sitorus and occupied by Rev. Robert L. Tobing and his family. On March 16, 1987, the foundation of Wesley Day Hall, i.e., the educational building, was laid and seven months later the first floor was completed. It was dedicated by Bishop Johannes Gultom on October 25, 1987. Rev. J.

Frederick Ingold for the second time took over the pastoral leadership with Rameana Sihombing as assistant. Under his leadership the church made the decision to start building the present sanctuary, which had been long in planning, on the land east of the present fellowship hall. Chaired by Ms.  Maimunah Natasha, the earlier plan was to construct a taller building to allow a parking place below the sanctuary. That could have made a fuller use of the expensive land. The reason given for its alteration was that the original plan would be too expensive to build. With regard to the architectural design of the church, a symbolic scheme had been proposed by Rev. Robert L. Tobing, and it was followed through by the architect, Ir. Alice Salim and Ir. Ivan Arianto: Wesley Church sanctuary would reflect a combination of the Chinese word “ren” (  人   ) for human, and the Batak, a symbol of worship, following the style of a traditional Batak house. Then there should be sunlight entering the church from above, symbolizing the entry of God’s mercy into the life of the worshiping Christian. One can now see all these features in the sanctuary, seen from the outside as well as from the inside. || The groundbreaking ceremony for the new sanctuary took place on April 15, 1990. While the building process on the new sanctuary proceeded, the construction on the second floor of the educational building was begun in April, 1991. On October 27, 1991, the second floor of the educational building was completed and dedicated by Bishop Hamonangan Panggabean. The Sunday school was then able to do its work more effectively. On December 15, the same year, the new sanctuary was completed. || Large amounts of money were needed to purchase the three parcels of land and to construct the buildings needed by Wesley Methodist Church. Nearly every member made his or her contribution toward the purchasing of these parcels of land and the completion of the building projects. Many friends of Wesley Church also helped. A few of Wesley Methodist Church members and friends, however, were extraordinary generous in the use of their time and talents as well as their money in order to reach the goals of the various projects. Several fund-raising bazaars were held and these few persons provided the necessary leadership. In addition to the one held at Jalan Thamrin mentioned earlier, the bazaar during the 80s led by Ms. Maimunah Natasha was held at the church grounds while the bazaar during the 90s led by Ms. Susan Lita Tann was held at the Methodist School on Jalan Hang Tuah. Most of Wesley Church members were involved in these events, but the few persons mentioned gave much toward these projects. Certain persons stated that their names should not be mentioned in relation to their substantial contributions and their leadership, which is in keeping with the teaching of Christ concerning true giving.",

At the turn of the decade Wesley made a commitment to support mission and educational activities at Sukasari, a remote village about 300 kilometers south-east of Medan. There was a small Methodist Church in this impoverished Javanese transmigration settlement, but there was no school. Children, many of those were from the Methodist families there, roamed around in the village because they did not go to school. After much prayer, Wesley decided to provide financial support for a Methodist Elementary School at the village. Since the project began, small groups from Wesley Church have often visited Sukasari, preaching the Gospel there and showing God’s love to the little pupils, and sometimes to the church members as well, by giving useful presents from Wesley. || The Sukasari project continues to this day, and it has greatly enriched the life of Wesley Methodist congregation. The school is now one of the best in that region and many pupils have joined the little church there. On completing elementary programs, students have to attend junior high school elsewhere.

This trend is marked with powerful singing of short choruses and hand clapping to the accompaniment of loud drum bands, as well as fiery sermons and prayers uttered with great emotion. Many people of today seem to enjoy this new trend of contemporary style worship. Some Wesley Church members have begun to introduce this kind of singing to Wesley Church. Those who are dissatisfied with Wesley’s seeming reluctance to adopt the new trend have left and joined the newly established congregations many of which hold their Sunday services at conference halls of various major hotels in the city. || The second challenge is related to the need of English-speaking pastors in the future. Several English-speaking Methodist churches have been opened in Jakarta and will be organized in Palembang. Many more are needed, but due to the shortage of English-speaking Methodist pastors, the English-speaking work has not been able to go far. || Another challenge of the new millennium is ethnic pluralism within Wesley congregation. In fact, this ethnic pluralism is a positive factor for church renewal and growth. For too long various churches around the world have practiced racial and ethnic segregation. Integration is in line with the Christian faith. Wesley needs to grapple with this challenge during this period of transition as we enter the twenty first century. As the Global Age ushers in, ethnic and racial pluralism will become more and more a reality. Wesley is now facing the challenge. But this challenge must be met with the conviction that the church is for all sorts of people. It must be noted that the history of Wesley Methodist Church’s ministry or pastoral leadership has been characterized by ethnic and racial plurality. Americans, English, Bataks, Javanese, Chinese and Indians have served as pastors or assistant pastors at this church. Furthermore, this church has long been described as “International in nature”.
